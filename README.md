# An App that has to fetch some blog posts and render a histogram based on the frequency of every post in each month of 2019;

I tried to store every month from the createdAt key and count them so I can know how many times a post was created in that month.

I could get the month as a Key and the times it repeated as a Value but I think that led me to some hard times on the visx library as I couldn't get the bars for every month to display properly.Now that I'm thinking I should've store them as objects in an array so I can iterate easier through that array, as in an example I found for the visx library.

Also had to spend some time on Apollo and GraphQL as I never touched them before but I don't mind that cause I learned a lot of stuff and that's the goal right now.
